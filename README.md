# SFM-SLAM

General outline of a Structure from Motion (SfM) pipeline:

Input: A set of overlapping images of a scene captured from different viewpoints.

*Feature extraction and description:*
a. Detect keypoints in each image using a feature detection algorithm (e.g., SIFT, SURF, or ORB).
b. Compute descriptors for each keypoint to facilitate matching (using the same algorithm as in step 2a).

*Feature matching:*
a. Match keypoints across pairs of images using descriptor similarity (e.g., nearest-neighbor matching or FLANN).
b. Apply a robust estimation technique (e.g., RANSAC) to remove outlier matches.

*Incremental SfM:* \\
a. Select an initial pair of images with a high number of matches and a suitable baseline.
b. Estimate the relative camera poses and 3D positions of the matched keypoints using a technique like the five-point algorithm or the eight-point algorithm.
c. Perform bundle adjustment to minimize the reprojection error and refine the initial reconstruction.
d. Incrementally add more images to the reconstruction by:
i. Estimating camera pose for each new image using PnP (Perspective-n-Point) algorithms.
ii. Triangulating new 3D points from matched keypoints.
iii. Updating the existing 3D points with new observations.
iv. Applying bundle adjustment to refine the updated reconstruction.

Loop closure and global optimization (optional):
a. Detect loop closures, where the camera revisits a previously observed part of the scene.
b. Apply global optimization techniques (e.g., global bundle adjustment or pose graph optimization) to correct for drift and improve the overall consistency of the reconstruction.

Output: A sparse 3D point cloud representing the scene, along with the estimated camera poses.

This general outline of an SfM pipeline can be adapted or extended to include additional steps or variations, depending on the specific application and requirements.
