Structure from Motion (SfM) Pipeline
This project implements a Structure from Motion (SfM) pipeline to reconstruct a 3D point cloud and estimate camera poses from a set of overlapping images.

Requirements
Python 3.x
OpenCV
NumPy
Installation
Install Python 3.x from the official Python website.
Install OpenCV and NumPy using pip:
Copy code
pip install opencv-python opencv-contrib-python numpy
Usage
Import the StructureFromMotion class from the sfm.py file.
Create an instance of the class with the input images and the desired feature detector.
Call the run method to execute the SfM pipeline.
Example:

python
Copy code
from sfm import StructureFromMotion

images = [...] # Load your images here as a list of NumPy arrays
sfm = StructureFromMotion(images, feature_detector='SIFT')
sfm.run()
SfM Pipeline Overview
The SfM pipeline consists of the following steps:

Detect and describe keypoints in each image.
Match keypoints across pairs of images.
Robustly estimate matches using RANSAC or another robust estimation technique.
Initialize the 3D structure and camera poses with a suitable pair of images.
Incrementally add images to the reconstruction by:
Estimating camera pose for each new image.
Triangulating new 3D points from matched keypoints.
Updating existing 3D points with new observations.
Applying bundle adjustment to refine the updated reconstruction.
Optionally, detect loop closures and apply global optimization to improve the overall consistency of the reconstruction.
Customization
You can customize the SfM pipeline by modifying the methods in the StructureFromMotion class. This can include changing the feature detector, matching algorithm, or robust estimation technique, as well as adding new functionality or optimization steps.

This README.md file provides an overview of the project, installation and usage instructions, and some basic information on the SfM pipeline. You can further expand this file to include more detailed information, troubleshooting tips, or any additional instructions specific to your implementation.
